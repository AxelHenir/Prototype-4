# Prototype-4

Godlike Platforming

When a player is unknowingly given godly powers, will their objectives change? Will the game feel fun anymore?

In this game prototype, I will unlock the max speed, jumping and health for the player.
Will this affect the player's enjoyment or satisfaction with the game? How will the player use their newfound abilities?


========================================

#Playtesting Results

Playtesting revealed that most are oblivious to the fact that they have godlike powers until they encounter a situation where the outcome was not expeced.
Oftentimes, this lead to them retrying the same situation to confirm their hypothesis. Different testers did different things from this point- 
some went wild, killing every enemy, some tried to fly to the extremities of the map, one just completed the map normally.
A lot of the time, the players seemed to forget about the goal of reaching the golden door and were far more interested in their powers and abusing them.

After beating the game, I asked each player if they felt satisfied with beating the game.

Most responded yes, but that beating this kind of game once would always be enough for them. In effect, the same plot twist wouldn't be as effective.
Some responded "not really", saying that not being able to lose takes the fun out of the game. 

Going forward, if I were to develop this game further, I would want to make a custom level prototype that has checkpoints.
I want to add a system where as you progress in the level, your character must give up their godly powers, one at a time.
This could add an element of gameplay that reinstills the players with.. fear!
