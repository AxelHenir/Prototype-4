# Prototype-4

Godlike Platforming

When a player is unknowingly given godly powers, will their objectives change? Will the game feel fun anymore?

In this game prototype, I will unlock the max speed, jumping and health for the player.
Will this affect the player's enjoyment or satisfaction with the game? How will th eplayer use their newfoumd abilities?
